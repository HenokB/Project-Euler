# Project Euler problem and solutions




### [1. Multiples of 3 and 5](./problem 1.py)

-If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```py
def Problem_1():
    start_sum = 0
    for i in range(1000):
        if i%3==0 or i%5==0:
            start_sum += i
    return start_sum
Problem_1()
```
### [2. Even Fibonacci numbers](./problem 2.py)
- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```py
def problem_2():
    a1 = 1
    a2 = 2
    a3 = a1+a2
    sum = a2
    while a3 < 4000000:
        if a3 % 2 == 0: # is it even?
            sum += a3

        a1 = a2
        a2 = a3
        a3 = a1+a2
    print(sum)
    return
problem_2()
```
### [3. Largest prime factor](./problem 3.py)
- The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
  What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
```py
def pf(x):
    prime = []
    for i in range(2,x+1):
        if x%i==0:
            break
        prime += [i]
    return max(prime)
pf(100)
```
### [4. Largest palindrome product](./problem 4.py)
- A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
```py
all_palindrome_numbers = []
for x in range(100,999):
    for i in range(100,999):
        num = str(i*x).split()[0]
        if len(num) == 6:
            if num[0] == num[-1] and num[1] == num[-2] and num[2] == num[-3]:
                all_palindrome_numbers.append(i * x)
print (max(all_palindrome_numbers))
```
### [5. Smallest multiple](./problem 5.py)
- 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
```py
import fractions
from math import gcd


def problem5():
    solution = 1
    for i in range(1, 21):
        solution *= i // fractions.gcd(i, solution)
    return str(solution)

print(problem5())


# using the worst case possible and doing it in the worst way. I challenge you to write a worse one.
def pr(x):
    a = []
    for i in range(1,x):
        if (i % 2 ==0 and i % 3==0 and i % 4==0 and i % 5 ==0 and i % 6==0 and i % 7==0 and i % 8 ==0 and i % 9==0 and i % 10==0 and i % 11 ==0 and i % 12 ==0 and i % 13==0 and i % 14==0 and i % 15 ==0 and i % 16==0 and i % 17==0 and i % 18 ==0 and i % 19==0 and i % 20==0):
            a+=[i]
    return min(a)
```
### [6. Sum square difference](./problem 6.py)
- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```py
a  = 0
b  = 0
for i in range(1, 111):
    a+=(i**2)
for i in range(1, 111):
    b+=i
print((b**2)-a)
```
